# Code Quality Review

Review changes for correctness and design quality, and simplify generated code without changing required behavior.

Version: 0.1.0. One standalone instruction skill; no mandatory sibling plugin,
account connection, MCP server, hook, service, or desktop app.

## Use

Ask the host to use `code-quality-review` for the relevant task, or explicitly invoke
the skill where supported. Installation does not execute work or grant access.
Read [the active skill](skills/code-quality-review/SKILL.md) for task branches and
its [reference index](skills/code-quality-review/references/README.md) for optional resources.
Install through the configured marketplace after release promotion; repository
presence alone does not prove host compatibility or installation readiness.

## Boundaries and verification

Use current task authorization and actual tools. No particular machine path,
local-only host, required tracker, Git identity convention, or automatic commit
is assumed. Archived helpers/native resources are source-only, not enabled runtime.
Native host behavior and cross-platform integrations are unverified by source
preparation. The release process must record actual structural/behavioral results.

## Sources and licenses

See [source notes](docs/source-notes.md), [file provenance](docs/provenance.json),
[third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md), and [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
New packaging is MIT; retained resources keep their original terms.
Combined package license expression: `MIT`.
